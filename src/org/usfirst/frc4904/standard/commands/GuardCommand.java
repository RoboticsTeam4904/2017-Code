/**
 * GuardCommand takes in two commands, a background and a primary.
 * When GuardCommand is started, both commands will start in parallel.
 * However, when the primary command ends, the background command will be cancelled
 * and the GuardCommand instance will end as well.
 * This is especially useful when a two commands need to be run in parallel,
 * but one of them (the background command) runs indefinitely. Using GuardCommand, that
 * background command will be run for the duration of the primary command, or for less time
 * if it ends by itself. Note that in the latter case, the primary command will finish independently.
